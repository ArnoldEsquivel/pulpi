# Backend Project Structure Overview

## Introduction
Hello, my name is Arnold Esquivel. In this backend project, I have implemented Node.js with a dependency injection pattern to abstract the business logic, aiming for long-term maintainability and scalability. Below is an overview of the project structure, explaining the purpose of each directory and how they contribute to the application's architecture.

## Development Process Overview

#### Analyzing Requirements
The development process began with a thorough analysis of the project requirements. I identified the main entities and determined their relationships, ensuring a solid foundation for the application's data model.

#### Planning Endpoints
With a clear understanding of the required entities, I compiled a list of necessary endpoints (EPs) for the application. This step was critical for outlining the scope of the project and the functionalities that needed to be implemented.

#### Defining Acceptance Criteria
For each endpoint, I meticulously defined the requirements and acceptance criteria. This involved considering the input and output specifications and ensuring that each EP met the business needs effectively.

#### Architectural Decisions
Upon setting the requirements, I defined the architecture to be followed. Opting for an SQL-based database was a strategic choice, influenced by its efficiency in handling write operations and relational data structuring.

#### Laying the Groundwork
With a strategy in place, I initiated the project by laying down its foundation, configuring the necessary development environment, and establishing the project's structure as per the chosen architectural pattern.

#### Iterative Development
Development proceeded iteratively, focusing on one endpoint at a time. For each EP, I developed and rigorously tested against the predefined requirements and acceptance criteria to ensure correctness and reliability.

#### Documentation and Testing
Throughout the development process, I maintained comprehensive documentation and conducted extensive testing. This approach not only streamlined the development process but also ensured that each part of the application functioned as intended.

#### Conclusion
The meticulous planning, strategic architectural choices, and methodical development approach reflect my commitment to delivering a robust and well-structured backend solution. This process underscores the importance of a well-thought-out design and development strategy in creating efficient, maintainable, and scalable software.

## Project Structure

### `src/api/controllers`
The `controllers` directory contains the controller files, which are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning responses to the client. The controllers delegate business logic to the services and send back the service's response to the client.

### `src/api/services`
Located in the `services` directory, these files define the core business logic of the application. Services interact with models to retrieve, create, update, or delete data from the database and perform necessary processing.

### `src/api/routes`
The `routes` folder contains the route definitions for the API. Each route is associated with a controller that handles the request when the route is matched. The routes act as the entry point to the controllers.

### `src/api/models`
The `models` directory is where the application's data structures are defined. Using Sequelize ORM, these models represent the tables in the MySQL database and are used by services to interact with the database.

### `src/api/docs`
Swagger documentation is placed in the `docs` folder. These YAML files describe the endpoints, request bodies, and responses of the API, providing a contract for what the API expects and what it will return.

### `src/config`
Configuration settings for the application are stored within the `config` directory. It includes database configuration (`db.js`) and Swagger setup (`swaggerConfig.js`), which are crucial for the application's operation and documentation.

### `src/middleware`
Middleware functions are housed in the `middleware` directory. They are used to process requests before they reach the controllers or to handle errors and other common tasks that need to be executed across different routes.

### `src/middleware/dtos`
DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) reside in the `dtos` folder. They are used to validate the shape and data integrity of requests coming into the server. This ensures that the data is as expected and helps to pinpoint errors in the data transfer process.

## Swagger Documentation
This project has been thoroughly documented using Swagger to describe its RESTful API. Swagger documentation helps both developers and users understand the capabilities of the API, providing clear instructions and details about the API's functions.
